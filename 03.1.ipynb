    "Who knows about trees and representation of trees? Biologists!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how we landed on [ETE Toolkit](http://etetoolkit.org/),a Python framework for the analysis and visualization of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a nice library with plenty of cool features we're not going to describe here, because first of all, we're not using the fast majority, and it's not directly relevant for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: The vizualization module was still too limited for what we needed to do.\n",

    "## d3js\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as I hate web development, it is still a lot more pleasant than going the native clients, so the whole UI of the tool I'm going to show you is written in HTML/JS/CSS, and the main vizualization library we used is [d3js](https://d3js.org/), for no specific reason besides the fact it is relatively well documented, and maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lookyloo intro\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen many tools, and none of them was solving all the problems we wanted to solve:\n",
    "* Full rendering of the page, including execution of javascript, and loading of 3rd party visual contents\n",
    "* Understanding of what's happening when a web page is rendered in a browser\n",
    "* Reproducibility of a capture over time to allow a comparison\n",
    "* Allow to pass initial parameters (referer, user agent, cookies)\n",
    "\n",
    "Play Time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to Lookyloo [public instance](https://lookyloo.circl.lu/), make a capture, and investigate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, capture the URLs we used in the 1st part of the course, and see what's happening."
