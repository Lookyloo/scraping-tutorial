    "Who knows about trees and representation of trees? Biologists!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how we landed on [ETE Toolkit](http://etetoolkit.org/), a Python framework for the analysis and visualization of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a nice library with plenty of cool features we're not going to describe here, because  we're not using the vast majority, and it's not directly relevant for now.\n",

    "**Problem**: The vizualization module was still too limited for what we needed to do.\n",

    "## d3js\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as I hate web development, it is still a lot more pleasant than going the native clients, so the whole UI of the tool I'm going to show you is written in HTML/JS/CSS, and the main vizualization library we used is [d3js](https://d3js.org/), for no specific reason besides the fact it is relatively well documented, maintained, and I used it before.\n",

    "## Lookyloo intro\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen many tools, and none of them was solving all the problems we wanted to solve:\n",
    "* Full rendering of the page, including execution of javascript, and loading of 3rd party visual contents\n",
    "* Understanding of what's happening when a web page is rendered in a browser\n",
    "* Reproducibility of a capture over time to allow a comparison\n",
    "* Allow to pass initial parameters (referer, user agent, cookies)\n",
    "\n",
    "Play Time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to Lookyloo [public instance](https://lookyloo.circl.lu/), make a capture, and investigate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, capture the URLs we used in the 1st part of the course, and see what's happening."
