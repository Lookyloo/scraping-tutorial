    "It# Part IV: Installing lookyloo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools used in the backend \n",
    "\n",
    "Lookyloo is glue and tooling to put together a bunch of existing projects. You can find a detailled description of the implementation [on the website](https://www.lookyloo.eu/docs/main/implementation-details.html), but to keep it simple, the main libraries and tools used are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redis: key/value database, used for caching \n",
    "* Splash and Scrapy: instrumentation and capture of the websites\n",
    "* ETE Toolkit: pure python library to handle phylogenetic trees\n",
    "* D3JS: a JavaScript library to vizualize things\n",
    "* Bootstrap: to make a website pretty \n",
    "* Flask & Jinja: pure python webserver, and the templating module\n",
    "\n",
    "And we also have connector to 3rd party modules such as VirusTotal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install guide\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely strongly to install lookyloo on a recent Ubuntu. I personaly use the latest release (now, 21.10), but Lookyloo is also compatible with the most recent LTS (now, 20.04), feel free to use either. \n",
    "If you use an other operating system, you're on your own, and I won't be able to help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the [official install guide](https://www.lookyloo.eu/docs/main/install-lookyloo.html), and let me know if you have questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run lookyloo directly on your system, but if you prefer using a virtual machine, go for it. The examples I showed you until now were running on my main system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Install lookyloo (on your host, or in a VM)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `poetry run update --yes` will automatically generate `config/generic.json`, and the system should be ready to go, but you probably still want to have a look at the configuration and edit `config/generic.json` accordingly. The config file works out of the box, but you may want to configure `users` in order to access the hidden captures, and other development related features from the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every feature is documented in the `_notes` key in `config/generic.json.sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launch\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the installation went well, you can now [launch lookyloo](https://www.lookyloo.eu/docs/main/install-lookyloo.html#_run_splash). \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have splash **and** lookyloo itself running, otherwise the captures won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "* If you installed it directly on your host, ou can check if splash is up on runnig by opening http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser, and lookyloo on http://127.0.0.1:5100/.\n",
    "* If you installed in a virtual machine, use the IP address of the machine instead of 127.0.0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic usage guide \n",
    "\n",
    "Go to http://127.0.0.1:5100/, click on `Start a new capture`, and run it on the website of your choice. It can be anything but avoid websites requiring a login: the result may not be as interesing.\n",
    "\n",
    "After one or two minutes, you should see a tree. If you don't, there is an issue with your installation, you should see something in the logs (either lookyloo or splash).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diasgnostic and debug\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to splash, paste the URL, run the capture. \n",
    "    * If it works, splash is working as expected. \n",
    "    * If it doesn't splash may not be able to access the internet? Look at the logs.\n",
    "2. *Assuming splash works* look in the terminal you started lookyloo in and there should be an error. Paste it in the search bar of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking as simpler websites\n",
    "\n",
    "Most websites you use on a daily basis will probably be way to complicated to investigate at first, so we will start with more simple ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**: Capture a simple website, and look at the examples on the herokuapp.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CIRCL website: http://circl.lu\n",
    "2. Copy and paste the URLs on [this page](https://lookyloo-testing.herokuapp.com/), and discuss what happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Investigate your own website\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Go back to the first website you tried, and describe what is going on."
