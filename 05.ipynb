    "We have a running Lookyloo instance and can use it to correlate captures and parts of captures with eachother, but it is definitely not enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feeding manually URLs to lookyloo using the web interface is nice, but it doesn't scale if we have a big amount of URLs to process\n",
    "2. Having a lot of indicators in a lookyloo instance, but we want to share them with colleagues, partners, and correlate them with other datasources\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will use the APIs of Lookyloo, and discover the MISP API in order to make our work more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that what we're dong here is pretty much the best case scenario, where there are Python modules for both services and we do not have to reverse engineer the protocol of either services, and then write a python module.\n",

    "[PyLookyloo](https://github.com/Lookyloo/pylookyloo) is a very simple python module that makes it easier to interact with a Lookyloo instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: use it to automatically push a bunch of URLs to a Lookyloo intance. This list of URL can come from [phishtank](http://phishtank.org/phish_search.php?valid=y&active=y&Search=Search), or other sources you know about. \n",

    "\n",
    "The code below is an example from the Pylookyloo [example directory](https://github.com/Lookyloo/PyLookyloo/blob/main/examples/enqueue_list.py). You can use it directly, and improve it later on to fit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: you need to install the python module `pylookyloo`. If you're running the notebook as recommended using `poetry`, you can install it by starting a shell in the virtual environment and install with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry shell\n",
    "pip install pylookyloo\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important**: do not start by pushing houndred of URLs, 5 to 10 will be enough at first."
